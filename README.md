# Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping

## Objective

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the use of **aggregate functions** and **grouping** operations in SQL. You'll apply `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` to the `library_db` schema to summarize and filter data.

## File Included

- `task4_aggregate_queries_library_db.sql`  
  Contains SQL queries using aggregate functions and grouping on the `library_db` schema.

## Requirements

- MySQL Workbench
- A running `library_db` database with the following tables (given in Task1):
  - `author`
  - `book`
  - `book_author`
  - `category`
  - `member`
  - `loan`

Ensure that the database has been seeded with the sample data provided in earlier tasks.


## How to Use

1. Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench or SQLite).
2. Connect to the `library_db` database.
3. Open the `task4_aggregate_queries_library_db.sql` file.
4. Run each query individually or execute the whole script.
